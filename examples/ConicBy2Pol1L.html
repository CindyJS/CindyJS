  <p>You should <em>not</em> be seeing any red lines in this example,
    since they should be covered by green lines in the same
    location.</p>
  <p>If the cyan points are located on the lines, this gives you
    access to conics which touch a given pair of tangents in given
    points of contact.</p>
