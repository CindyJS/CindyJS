  <p>You should <em>not</em> be seeing a red line in this example,
    since it should be covered by a green line in the same
    location.</p>
  <p>If the cyan point is located on the green line, this gives you
    access to conics which touch a given tangent in a given
    point of contact.</p>
  <p>In <a href="javascript:ex1()">this configuration</a>, vertically
    moving the cyan point will cause the conics to switch roles unless
    avoided by complex tracing.</p>
