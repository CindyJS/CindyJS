    <p>
      The initial situation shows some <em>very</em> degenerate situation
      for the intersection of two conics, where both the conics involved are
      in fact undefined. This exposes a problem discussed in
      <a href="https://github.com/CindyJS/CindyJS/issues/132">issue #132</a>
      which would lead to an exception during initialization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving from that situation is non-trivial as well, since it may
      lead to extremely slow responses due to tracing problems. See
      <a href="https://github.com/CindyJS/CindyJS/issues/136"> issue #136</a>.
