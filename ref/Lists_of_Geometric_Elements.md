##  Lists of Geometric Elements

Accessing the geometric elements of a Cinderella construction represents an important interface between CindyScript and a geometric construction.
In particular, if for some reason the element names (i.e., labels) are unknown or varying, one needs a way to retrieve the geometric elements.
This is done with operators that return lists of elements of a particular kind.

#### All points of the construction: `allpoints()`

#### All lines of the construction: `alllines()`

#### All segments of the construction: `allsegments()`

#### All circles of the construction: `allcircles()`

#### All conics of the construction: `allconics()`

#### All masses of the construction: `allmasses()`

#### All springs of the construction: `allsprings()`

#### All elements incident to a given one: `allsegments(‹geo›)`

#### All elements of the construction: `allelements()`

Please refer to the examples section for more on the use of these operators.
