# Complex Curves

**Complex Curves** is a [JavaScript
library](https://github.com/kranich/ComplexCurves) and
[website](http://complexcurves.org) for visualization of complex plane
algebraic curves.

It is based on Chapter 6 of

Stefan Kranich, Continuity in Dynamic Geometry: An Algorithmic
Approach, PhD thesis, Technical University of Munich, 2016,
[http://nbn-resolving.de/urn/resolver.pl?urn:nbn:​de:bvb:91-diss-20160418-1281075-1-5](http://nbn-resolving.de/urn/resolver.pl?urn:nbn:de:bvb:91-diss-20160418-1281075-1-5).
